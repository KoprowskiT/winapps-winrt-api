# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Hosting.DesktopWindowXamlSource.NavigateFocus

## -description
Attempts to programmatically give focus to the [DesktopWindowXamlSource](desktopwindowxamlsource.md) in the desktop application.

## -parameters
### -param request
An object that specifies the reason and other optional info for the focus navigation.

## -returns
An object that provides data for the focus navigation request.

## -remarks
When you add a **DesktopWindowXamlSource** to your desktop application, by default the **DesktopWindowXamlSource** does not automatically handle focus navigation via keyboard events such as the **Tab** or arrow keys. Use this method in conjunction with the [GotFocus](desktopwindowxamlsource_navigatefocus) event to programmatically give focus when the user navigates to the **DesktopWindowXamlSource**.
